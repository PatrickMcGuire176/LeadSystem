AXIOS


The services folder is inspired by Angular architecture (well, I am an Angular developer too).

In Angular there is a feature called Dependency Injection that allows us to inject a service anywhere in a project. Most of the time, a service used to manage API integrations. So, it separated from logic in the component.

Service is not a react component. It simply a javascript function to manage API integration based on the type of data.

To be clear, here is how i write a service in most of my react projects.
